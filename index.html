                About Me
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hey! thanks for visiting my site. its pretty simple, i like it that way. I'm a programmer and I build a
                lot of things, like websites, apps and even just fun little projects. I have been doing this for quite a
                while and i enjoy it. <br>

                <strong class="silk">When did I start?</strong> <br>

                Well, realistically probably in late highschool 2016. But professionally, back in 2018.

                <br>

                <strong class="silk">What do I do?</strong> <br>

                Specificaly thats a very hard question to answer. I do a lot of things, I'm good at a few and fairly
                compentent in others. But if you interested in my technologies, well here's what I use.

                </dt>
                <dd>HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, SCSS and
                    anything withing
                    the scope of angular
                    <br>
                    <strong>How well do I work with these?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I'm pretty good with these, I can build a website from scratch if i have to.

                <dd><a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJs</a>, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Firebase, and
                    Python.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Thats a lot are sure you can handle that?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Most of us devs do alot and so we know alot too. I prefer building with NodeJs and Express and a
                    MongoDB
                    database, but over the years ive picked up python and firebase so that's also a skill I have.
                    <br>
                    <strong>What about SQL?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Sql was one of my first databases to venture into so I can still work with it, however i use ORMs
                    like <a href="https://typeorm.io/" target="_blank">TypeORM</a>

                        target="_blank">Kotlin</a>
                    <br>
                    <strong>What about Java?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I have worked with Java before, but I prefer to use flutter and kotlin for mobile development
                    because it a way easier path to take.
                    <br>
                    <strong>So you like it easy?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Well yes! I'm an advocate for effeciency and I like to get things done quickly and easily.

                    <strong>What do you use these for?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I use git for version control and for hosting my projects, docker for containerizing my
                    applications, kubernetes for managing my containers, and GCP for hosting my applications. I'm
                    familiar with the cloud space and good number of services on GCP like App Engine, Cloud Run, Cloud
                    Functions, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Cloud Build and GKE.

                    This is one of my most recent projects that I sort of completed. I write code in many frameworks
                    that
                    employ
                    state management solutions, you know like RxJS with react and NgXs in Angular

                    So my main problem
                    with
                    these
                    technologies is that they are really complex to learn and most times you don't even need them
                    for
                    your
                    run
                    on the mill type projects. But mostly you need part of their functionality in your app but they
                    force
                    you to
                    do the whole boilerplate, so I made a very minimal state management solution that works and best
                    of
                    all
                    you
                    can scale it as you wish. Bitz is very experimental and may need to be optimized but it does
                    work.
