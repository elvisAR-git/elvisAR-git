                        This one is fairly old. Does exactly as stated. Compute similarities between code that's
                        uploaded and code that's already there.

                        The algorithm is simple and complex too and not well optimized yet. I had plans to integrate
                        with open source code repo APIs but shelved it because I was learning a lot of things too fast.
                        Gained a lot of AJAX skills on this one.

                        This one is just a creative way to make a rhythm on your browser. This is one of my earliest
                        projects in Javascript so it might be interesting to look at considering what I was learning at
                        the time was just vanilla. If you manage to make music with it, you must be good :)

                    <p>
                        This one is unfinished but functional. It's one of my creative coding projects where I intended
                        to build a music player in vanilla JS and add a complex graphical visualizer system for the
                        audio stream, something you'd see in very high end music editing software like Fruity loops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To see what I mean, just open it and select any audio file, preferably music and just enjoy the
                        bleak white graph for now. I do intend to pursue this project to completion at my best of time.

                    <h3>Blitz</h3>
                    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> TypeScript</p>
                    <p>
                        This is one of my most recent projects that I sort of completed. I write code in many frameworks
                        that employ state management solutions, you know like RxJS with react and NgXs in Angular.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So my main problem with these technologies is that they are really complex to learn and most
                        times you don't even need them for your run on the mill type projects. But mostly you need part
                        of their functionality in your app but they force you to do the whole boilerplate, so I made a
                        very minimal state management solution that works and best of all you can scale it as you wish.
                        Blitz is very experimental and may need to be optimized but it does work.
