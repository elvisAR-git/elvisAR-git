                    This one is unfinished but functional. It's one of my creative coding projects where I intended to

                    and

                    This is one of my most recent projects that I sort of completed. I write code in many frameworks
                    that
                    employ
                    state management solutions, you know like RxJS with react and NgXs in Angular

                    So my main problem
                    with
                    these
                    technologies is that they are really complex to learn and most times you don't even need them
                    for
                    your
                    run
                    on the mill type projects. But mostly you need part of their functionality in your app but they
                    force
                    you to
                    do the whole boilerplate, so I made a very minimal state management solution that works and best
                    of
                    all
                    you
                    can scale it as you wish. Bitz is very experimental and may need to be optimized but it does
                    work.
