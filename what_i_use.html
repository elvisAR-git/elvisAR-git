                <dd>HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, SCSS and
                    anything within
                    the scope of angular
                    <br>
                    <strong>How well do I work with these?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I'm pretty good with these, I can build a website from scratch if i have to.

                <dd><a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJs</a>, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Firebase, and
                    Python.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Thats a lot are sure you can handle that?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Most of us devs do alot and so we know alot too. I prefer building with NodeJs and Express and a
                    MongoDB
                    database, but over the years ive picked up python and firebase so that's also a skill I have.
                    <br>
                    <strong>What about SQL?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Sql was one of my first databases to venture into so I can still work with it, however i use ORMs
                    like <a href="https://typeorm.io/" target="_blank">TypeORM</a>

                        target="_blank">Kotlin</a>
                    <br>
                    <strong>What about Java?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I have worked with Java before, but I prefer to use flutter and kotlin for mobile development
                    because it a way easier path to take.
                    <br>
                    <strong>So you like it easy?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Well yes! I'm an advocate for effeciency and I like to get things done quickly and easily.

                    <strong>What do you use these for?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I use git for version control and for hosting my projects, docker for containerizing my
                    applications, kubernetes for managing my containers, and GCP for hosting my applications. I'm
                    familiar with the cloud space and good number of services on GCP like App Engine, Cloud Run, Cloud
                    Functions, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Cloud Build and GKE.
