                <strong>Welcome to my retro blog!</strong> This is a demonstration of early 2000s web design aesthetics.
                Back when the web was simple, clean, and functional. No fancy frameworks, just pure HTML and CSS.

                    <h3>The Beauty of Simple Web Design</h3>
                    <p><strong>Posted:</strong> December 15, 2025 at 10:30 AM by Elvis Moraa</p>
                    <p>
                        Remember when websites were just HTML and CSS? No build tools, no package managers, no frameworks.
                        Just you, your text editor, and a browser. Those were simpler times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've been reflecting on how web development has evolved over the years. While modern tools give us
                        incredible power, there's something to be said about the elegance of a well-crafted static site.
                        Fixed-width layouts, web-safe fonts, and simple color schemes made the web accessible to everyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This blog is a tribute to that era. No JavaScript frameworks, no CSS preprocessors, no bundlers.
                        Just clean, semantic HTML and straightforward styling.

                    <h3>Building Systems That Scale</h3>
                    <p><strong>Posted:</strong> December 10, 2025 at 2:15 PM by Elvis Moraa</p>
                    <p>
                        As a Machine Learning Engineer and Software Architect, I've learned that scalability isn't just
                        about handling more users. It's about building systems that can evolve with changing requirements
                        while maintaining reliability and performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Pariti Inc, we scaled our platforms to serve over 100,000 users. The key was understanding the
                        fundamentals: efficient data structures, proper caching strategies, asynchronous processing, and
                        monitoring everything that matters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technologies come and go, but principles remain constant. Whether you're working with microservices,
                        monoliths, or serverless architectures, the fundamentals of good system design don't change.

                    <p><strong>Posted:</strong> December 5, 2025 at 9:00 AM by Elvis Moraa</p>
                    <p>
                        Machine Learning seemed like magic when I first encountered it back in 2018. Models that could
                        learn patterns from data and make predictions? It was fascinating and intimidating at the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started with the basics: linear regression, decision trees, and simple neural networks. Each
                        concept built upon the last. The mathematics was challenging, but seeing models perform well on
                        real data made it all worthwhile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I work with production ML systems, vector databases like Qdrant, and large language models.
                        But I still remember the excitement of training my first model and watching it actually work.

                    <h3>The Power of Event-Driven Architecture</h3>
                    <p><strong>Posted:</strong> November 28, 2025 at 4:45 PM by Elvis Moraa</p>
                    <p>
                        Event-driven systems changed how I think about software architecture. Instead of tight coupling
                        between services, you have loosely coupled components that communicate through events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working with Kafka and Debezium at Pariti taught me the value of this approach. When services
                        communicate asynchronously through events, you gain flexibility, resilience, and the ability to
                        scale components independently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The shift in mindset from request-response to event-driven thinking takes time, but once it clicks,
                        you see opportunities for event-driven patterns everywhere.

                    <h3>Why I Still Love Static Sites</h3>
                    <p><strong>Posted:</strong> November 20, 2025 at 11:20 AM by Elvis Moraa</p>
                    <p>
                        In a world of complex web applications, there's something refreshing about static sites. No server-side
                        rendering, no database queries, no authentication flows. Just HTML, CSS, and maybe some JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This portfolio you're looking at right now? It's completely static. It loads instantly, works on
                        any browser, and requires minimal maintenance. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don't get me wrong, I build complex systems for a living. But for personal projects, for portfolios,
                        for blogs? Static sites are hard to beat. Fast, secure, and deployable anywhere.

                    <h3>Lessons from Building Production Systems</h3>
                    <p><strong>Posted:</strong> November 15, 2025 at 3:00 PM by Elvis Moraa</p>
                    <p>
                        Production systems teach you lessons that no tutorial or course ever can. When your code serves
                        real users with real expectations, you learn what matters and what doesn't.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've learned to prioritize monitoring and observability. You can't fix what you can't see. I've
                        learned the importance of graceful degradation. Systems will fail; plan for it. And I've learned
                        that premature optimization is indeed the root of all evil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every incident, every bug, every performance issue is a learning opportunity. The best engineers
                        aren't the ones who never make mistakes. They're the ones who learn from them and build better
                        systems as a result.
